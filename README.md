# WHIRLWING
what is a whirlwing? great question. whirlwing is a recursive acronym that also describes its function:
`WHIRLWING: Helps Ingest, Relate, Label, Wrangle Indexed, Normalized Geodata`
## program overview
the primary goal of whirlwing is to serve as a coordinating program between unorganized data and a database of metamosaics.
- `unorganized_drive -> ` **whirlwind.py** `-> organized_metadata, organized_object_storage`
### the idea of a metamosaics
a metamosaic is collection of orthomosaics, tiles, vectors, annotations. a given metamosaic is confined to a precise spatial footprint over a finite temporal period, but two metamosaics might contain a vastly different array of orthomosaics, tiles, and vector data.
